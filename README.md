Sure, here are the instructions to view the uploaded project on GitHub:

Go to the repository link that you provided earlier.
Once you are on the repository page, you will see a green "Code" button. Click on it and you will see a dropdown menu.
In the dropdown menu, you can either download the code as a ZIP file or copy the URL to clone the repository.
If you choose to clone the repository, you can do so using a Git client or through the command line using the following command: git clone <repository-url>
Once you have the code locally, you can open the project in any code editor of your choice and make modifications or run the project as required.
If you have enabled GitHub Pages, you can also view the website by going to the repository's settings and clicking on the "Pages" tab. From there, you can see the link to your website and view it in your browser.
